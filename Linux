❓What are 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀 and 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀 in Linux? How do you create them? What are the differences between these two types of links?
A "soft link" takes more, as it has an inode, and file contents (the path to the target file) it also has the name in the directory.

A "hardlink" only exists in the name in a directory- and specifies the inode number of the file.
Hardlink 👈
ln  [original filename] [link name] --> Hard link create
ln  -s [original filename] [link name] --> Soft link create
Hardlink : Filename => Inode <= My hard link
Softlink : inode <===file name <==soft link
